# Move
Blockchain driven political movement platform

Every countries where there are elections, eventually a few dominant parties, in most cases 2 or 3 monopolised the political landscape of the country. A lot of times, these few dominant parties seemed more interested in staying in power and very much out of touch with first reason they are elected which is to represent the best interest of the people. 

Regardless of which one of them that won, few things are common
1. They all get huge backing by large conglomerates who normally hedge their bets between them. Giving donations for the purpose of getting future favors. Which is why they seemed more interested to push the interest of these large conglomerates. 
2. They all seemed out of touch with the struggle of the common citizen.
3. They are bunch of idiots passing laws which they have no ideas about and seemed more interested to argue who got bigger dicks.
4. They are well entrenched in every part of the country making it seemed only way to make a change is to try be part of them.

Move is an attempt to break that cycle and transform the Political Movement all over the world. The platform will allow anyone to start a grass root movement. It will allow normal everyday citizen to work together and slowly build a movement that will not only be able to provide a better alternative that is already acceptable by most and get rid of these leaches that are sucking out the life of the future of your childrens.

This movement will have the following ideals:
- a manifesto that covers every issues affecting the people and it will be built based on majority consensus of the members
- the movement is by the people, for the people 
- leaderships of the movement must be elected by the members for each areas

The formation of manifesto for any new movement will follow the method done by Github in term of version control. From the main manifesto, a member will be able to put forward a new suggestion upon which multiple parties can work on them and eventually there will be a vote to commit the suggestion as part of the main manifesto.

The is a high possibility that a permission based hyper ledger will be used to developed most of the DAPP. Only the part which will require a decision such as below will require some form of smart contract to commit them into the block chain.
- voting on leadership positions
- addition to the movement manifesto 

How this application will grow will hopefully be through collective development. Anyone interested to be part of the team will be most welcome.
